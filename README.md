# Problem #1

## Setup
In the first problem, we are asked to dig out the maximum possible disc from a heart equation that was given. Then after scooping that disc out, we had to find the area of the heart using a numerical method. 

## Algorithm Description
In order to find the size of the disc, I decided to use numerical methods. From Professor Deng's image that he provided on the homework, I knew that any disc of maximal size would have it's center on the y-axis. Also, the top of the circle would be touching the uppermost point where the two halves of the heart meet. Furthermore, the picture also told us that the largest circle possible would be tangent to the lower half of the heart. Using this is created a method that would generate points on the lower half of the curve, that is governed by the equation in the image attached.
